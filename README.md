# UniPath
UniPath is an application which will serve as a portal for various services. Those services include buying and selling textbooks, getting daily supplies from local businesses, getting loan recommendations and having access to a campus map
The goal is to create a Web Application that can make students’ campus-life more convenient and easier. Students can sell their used products on the application; the application also allows students to check if there is something interesting to them and to buy. The categories of products will be listed on the application. The students who would like to get the student loan get to check the loan companies' information provided on the application. The application will also provide a map of campus for those students who are new to the university to get familiar with buildings around campus quickly.
